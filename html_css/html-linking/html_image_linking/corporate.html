            <p style="text-align: center;">Corporate events are company gatherings that bring business teams together in relaxed offsite settings. In so doing, they provide an invaluable break from routine, as well as a precious opportunity to have fun, collaborate, partake in team-building activities, and network with peers.But you knew all that already! The real challenge is keeping track of the myriad types of corporate events that take place. To help, weâ€™ve drawn from our experience of organizing them for businesses across Europe and the US to reveal a comprehensive list of corporate events (and what they bring to the table). </p>
