            <p style="text-align: center;">The use of a wedding ring has long been part of religious weddings in Europe and America, but the origin of the tradition is unclear. One possibility is the Roman belief in the Vena amoris, which was believed to be a blood vessel that ran from the fourth finger (ring finger) directly to the heart. Thus, when a couple wore rings on this finger, their hearts were connected. Historian Vicki Howard points out that the belief in the "ancient" quality of the practice is most likely a modern invention.In the United States of America, a groom's wedding band has not appeared until the early 20th century,while in Europe it has been part of the tradition since the ancient Romans, as witnessed by the jurist Gaius.The exit from the wedding ceremony is also called the "send off", and often includes traditional practices, such as the newlyweds and the wedding party bowing and kissing the knees of the elders in Ethiopian weddings. The send off often includes throwing rice (a symbol of prosperity and fertility) or other seeds at the newlyweds in most of the Western world, as well as for example India and Malaysia.Despite fears of the opposite, the use of uncooked rice for this purpose is not harmful to birds.Shoe tossing in place of rice has also been used in several cultures.</p>
